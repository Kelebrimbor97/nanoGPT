# nanoGPT

This is the repository for a Shakesperean text generator Transformer model as seen in this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) by Andrej Karpathy.
The `gpt-dev.ipynb` notebook was written by following along with the lecture and has some changes as well as notes of my own.

The original implementation by Karpathy, is a part of his course [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) and can be found  [here](https://github.com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture).
